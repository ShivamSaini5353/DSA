Question-1
A collection is a group of objects or it is a single entity that represents multiple objects.

Question-2
A Collection is an interface in Java. It is present in the package named java.util. It can be understood as a single unit with a group or a set of objects.
Collections is a class in Java. Specifically, it is a utility class in the package named java.util. 

Question-3
Reduces programming effort.
Increases program speed and quality.

Question-4
Java Collection framework: List, Set, Queue, MAp etc.

Question-5
A List interface is an ordered collection of values in which duplicated values are allowed. 
A Set interface in Java is an unordered collection of values in which duplicated values are not allowed.

Question-6
Iterator can traverse only in forward direction whereas ListIterator traverses both in forward and backward directions.

Question-7
Comparable provides a single sorting sequence and the Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences.

Question-8
A collision happens when two different keys happen to have the same hash code, or two keys.

Question-9
A HashMap uses a data structure known as the hash table in order to store the map's key-value pair. The hash code of the keys is used in the process of inserting key-value pairs into the database. Hence, each key in the map needs to be distinct from the others so that it can be used to retrieve the values.
TreeMap is another type of Map class, just like HashMap. The TreeMap class is an extension of the AbstractMap class and implements the NavigabelMap and SortedMap interfaces.

Question-10
LinkedHashMap is a Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface, with iteration order.
